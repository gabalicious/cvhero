## About the Projects

This project was originally started as a way to edit my resume with basic HTML, css. I later added Vue.js and a backend to store the data. Now the goal is to provide users with a convenient way to edit their resume online.

## Roadmap

- [x] Follow Mozilla's security recomndations for Express.js
- [ ] Transition from JSON file store to Prisma and PostgresSQL
- [ ] Add Github login
